good morning for everyone, first i would like to thank you for this opportunity
My name is Murillo Lopes and i work at the cvu plant at the body shop as an automation technician
and today i'm going to present you one of the improvements that we have done in this month
the title of this improvement is transporter's production rebalance

issue explanation:

on the above image we can see a little explanation of the problem
on the left transporter we had a piece present, but on the right transporter we didn't have a piece...
providing unbalance in our production line, and the operators couldn't continuing the proccess in the next equipament



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

solution proposed:

on the above left image we can see the pieces synchronized at the transporters, so the operators can pick up the pieces
and assemble in the next equipament F0, without any loss at the production!

on the right image we can see the screen created in odil with two buttons
these buttons were created to set the transporter's priority 
the d1 button is to set the priority on the left transporter
and the d2 button is to set the priority on the right transporter
so the supervisor or the senior operartor can decide whats is the priority in that zone, improving our efficiency everyday!
thank you!

probably questions:

1)lack of pieces
the main causes of this lack of pieces are the breaks in the equipament and the problems inside production like the number of 
operators present or logistics problems

2) why five minutes of gain?
because it's the equipament's cycle, and it's about five minutes...so if we don't have the pieces synchronized at the 
transporters we loss a cycle in the next equipament wich is 5 minutes

3)What made you do this improvement?
i made this improvement because i work at this production's line everyday and i saw a lot of problem inside this zone and also because
we were losing to much time, that's why i created this improvement to improve our production and our efficiency
